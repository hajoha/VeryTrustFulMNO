# Home Screen 
When starting the OMNT or touching the OMNT logo in the top left corner the ```home screen``` is displayed.
The ```home screen``` provides two tabs, the ```quick view``` and the ```detail view```
The ```quick view``` presents the most relevant network parameters and is automatically updated.
On the other hand the ```detail view``` is only  updated on load or refresh to make it more convenient to read.
Here are all information the OMNT can collect displayed. Different cards grouped the data into categories.
The data displayed is updates on load and swipe down. This way the data of the time of refresh can be analyzed.
The same grouping is applied to the data send to the InfluxDB.
